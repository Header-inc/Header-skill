# test/silence.test.sh — bin/header-audit {silence, rails RAIL-INERT}.
#
# THE SILENCE AXIS: information discarded without a signal. The generalization of
# SCHEMA-LAX — the defect is not that something broke, it is that NOTHING TOLD YOU.
#
#   RAIL-INERT     — machinery that is PRESENT and cannot fail (a gate whose checks
#                    end in `|| true`, CI with continue-on-error, an armed ratchet
#                    override). Strictly worse than absent: it earns rails credit
#                    while enforcing nothing, so everyone believes they are covered.
#   ENV-UNDECLARED — the code reads a config var nothing declares. Works on your
#                    laptop (it's in your shell), dies in the runner.
#   SWALLOW        — an exception handler with an empty body.
#
# Precision is the product decision throughout: a handler that LOGS or RE-RAISES is
# a decision, not a swallow; a declared var is not a finding; a commented-out
# escape hatch is not an inert gate. Those negative cases are the real tests.
